# This script adds execute permission to all subdirectories
# of the current directory for the group owner and all other users.
# Regular files are not affected.

# Find all entries that are directories (-type d) starting from the current directory (.).
# For each found directory, execute the 'chmod' command.
# 'go+x' adds execute permission for the group owner (g) and others (o).
# '{} +' is a more efficient way to pass multiple found directories to 'chmod'
# as arguments, rather than running 'chmod' once for each directory.
