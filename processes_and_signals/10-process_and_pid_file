#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script creates a PID file, prints a message indefinitely,
# and handles SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGQUIT signals.

PID_FILE="/var/run/myscript.pid"

# --- Signal Handling ---

# Function to clean up PID file and exit
cleanup() {
    echo "Cleaning up PID file and exiting."
    rm -f "$PID_FILE"
    exit 0
}

# Trap SIGTERM (signal 15) and SIGQUIT (signal 3) for cleanup and exit
trap "echo 'I hate the kill command'; cleanup" SIGTERM
trap "echo 'Y U no love me?!'" SIGINT
trap "cleanup" SIGQUIT # SIGQUIT also handles cleanup and exit

# --- Main Logic ---

# Create PID file with current script's PID
echo $$ > "$PID_FILE" || { echo "Error: Could not create PID file $PID_FILE"; exit 1; }

echo "PID file created: $PID_FILE with PID $$"

# Loop indefinitely, printing message
while true; do
    echo "To infinity and beyond"
    sleep 2
done
