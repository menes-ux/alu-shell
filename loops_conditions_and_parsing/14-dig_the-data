# This script analyzes apache-access.log to group visitors by IP and HTTP status code,
# then displays the count, IP, and status code, sorted by occurrence,
# avoiding 'for', 'while', 'until', and 'cut' keywords.

# 1. Use awk to extract the IP ($1) and HTTP status code ($9) from each line.
#    This produces lines like "IP HTTP_CODE".
# 2. Pipe the output to 'sort' to group identical lines together.
#    This is crucial for 'uniq -c' to count occurrences correctly.
# 3. Pipe the sorted output to 'uniq -c'.
#    'uniq -c' counts consecutive identical lines and prepends the count.
#    The output will be like "   COUNT IP HTTP_CODE".
# 4. Pipe the result to 'sort -rn'.
#    '-r' for reverse order (descending).
#    '-n' for numeric sort (important for counts).
#    This sorts the results by count from greatest to lowest.
awk '{print $1, $9}' apache-access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
